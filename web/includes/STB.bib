Using income tax record data in combination with survey data is a potential approach to address the problem; we consider here the UK’s pioneering ‘SPI adjustment’ method that implements this idea. Since 1992, the principal income distribution series (reported annually in Households Below Average Income) has been based on household survey data in which the incomes of a small number of ‘very rich’ individuals are adjusted using information from ‘very rich’ individuals in personal income tax return data. We explain what the procedure involves, reveal the extent to which it addresses survey under-coverage of top incomes, and show how it affects estimates of overall income inequality. More generally, we assess whether the SPI adjustment is fit for purpose and consider whether variants of it could be employed by other countries.},

	abstract = {We introduce JAS-mine, a new Java-based computational platform that features tools to support
the development of large-scale, data-driven, discrete-event simulations. JAS-mine is specifically designed
for both agent-based and microsimulation modelling, anticipating a convergence between the two approaches.
An embedded relational database management system provides tools for sophisticated input-output communications
and data storage, allowing the power of relational databases to be used within an object-oriented framework.
The JAS-mine philosophy encourages the separation of distinct concepts, objects and functionalities of
the simulation model, and advocates and supports transparency, flexibility and modularity in model design.
For instance, JAS-mine allows to store the list of regressors and their estimated coefficients externally to code,
making it easy to change the specification of regression models used in the simulation and achieving a complete
parallelisation between the tasks of the econometricians and those of the programmers. Moreover, tools for
uncertainty analysis and search over the parameter space are also built in.},
