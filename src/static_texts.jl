#### Notes

* Scotland actually has 3 lower rates of income tax rather than the single 20% basic rate shown - currently 19%,20% and 21%. Changing the 20% 'basic rate'
causes all three to move in sync.
* Likewise, changing the *Universal Credit: single 25+ adult* field changes the rates for young people and couples. 
* Scotland is [in the process of switching working-age families to Universal Credit from 'Legacy Benefits' (Income Support, Housing Benefit, etc.) ](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/constituency-data-universal-credit-roll-out/). I've written a [note on how this is modelled](https://stb-blog.virtual-worlds.scot/articles/2021/11/12/uc-legacy.html) - the code is [here](https://github.com/grahamstark/ScottishTaxBenefitModel.jl/blob/master/src/UCTransition.jl);
* the [£20pw 'uplift' to Universal Credit and Working Tax Credit](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2021/313/pdfs/uksiem_20210313_en.pdf), now [scheduled for removal in April 2022](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/budget-2021-what-you-need-to-know) is modelled as already removed. 
* Poverty and Inequality: 
 - based on [equivalised before housing costs income](https://www.gov.scot/publications/poverty-in-scotland-methodology/pages/household-income-definition/). 
 - uses 60% of *Scottish* (not UK) median income as poverty line (official target uses the UK median).
 - poverty line is [relative](https://www.gov.scot/publications/poverty-in-scotland-methodology/pages/poverty-definition/) - so may be different after your changes.

#### Key Assumptions

* *No behavioural changes*: increasing or decreasing taxes doesn't cause people to change how they work and earn;
* the model reports *entitlements to benefits and liability to taxes*, not receipts and payments - so we may overstate the costs of benefits since some eligible families may not claim the things they're entitled to. With taxes, some may be paid with a considerable delay, and some evaded or avoided.

See [the model blog](https://stb-blog.virtual-worlds.scot/) for more gory details (*content warning - very boring and rambling)*.

#### Known Problems

This is a new model. I'm now reasonably confident of its essential accuracy - it passes an [extensive test suite](https://github.com/grahamstark/ScottishTaxBenefitModel.jl/tree/master/test) but there are some aspects that
require investigation in the coming months. Notably:

* Income Tax revenues seem to be overstated by around £1bn pa compared to [official forecasts](https://www.fiscalcommission.scot/publications/scotlands-economic-and-fiscal-forecasts-august-2021/). Possibly much of this is due to how pension tax relief is treated;
* measures of inequality seem low compared to official statistics.

I'd very much welcome contributions and suggestions. If you spot anything odd or if you have any ideas for how this can be improved, you can:

* [Open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/grahamstark/ScottishTaxBenefitModel.jl/issues); or
