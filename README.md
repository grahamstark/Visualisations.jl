# Visualisations for the Scottish Tax and Benefit Model

This is where interactive visualisations of the [Scottish Tax Benefit Model](https://github.com/grahamstark/ScottishTaxBenefitModel.jl) will live.

This is a seperate repository so as to keep all the messy web stuff away from the model itself.

I don't plan on there being a full blown web user interface for all the model's hundreds of parameters, as it's very boring to write those and no-one actually uses them - for detailed work something reproducable like [Dr. Watson]() is likely a better bet. Instead, I'm going to make a series of small, single screen, interfaces in [Pluto](https://plutojl.org/) and [Dash](https://dash-julia.plotly.com/) on particular topics.
